# Connect-4 with Bunnies and Kitties

This is a simple web app Connect-4 style game where players take turns dropping
bunny 🐰 and kitty 🐱 emojis into the grid to try and get 4 in a row
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## How to Play

- The game board is a 6 row by 7 column grid.
- Player 1 is the bunny player and drops 🐰 emojis. Player 2 is the kitty player
  and drops 🐱 emojis.
- Players alternate turns choosing a column to drop their emoji into.
- The emoji falls to the lowest unoccupied row in the chosen column.
- The first player to get 4 of their emojis in a row wins!
